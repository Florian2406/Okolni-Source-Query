# Fork 

** Work in Progress **

This Fork changes the following:

Add ASync non-blocking methods

Add Send and Recieve Timeouts

Move to .NET 6 for CancellationTokenSupport on UDPClient Send/Recv Methods



Rework implementation of retries to work with Send/Recieve timeouts


Fix issues with A2S_Info/ServerInfo properties like Port/SteamID//SourceTv/Keywords/GameID which rely on the EDF (Extra Data Flag) which was improperly detecting those other fields being supported


Obsolete Connect method, use Setup instead. UDP is connection-less.


*** Note on Retries and Send/Recieve Timeouts ***

Keep in mind the potentially worst case for execution time timeout*retries*4 (1 send auth, 1 receive auth, 1 send challenge, 1 receive result).

For example, if you have send/recv timeout set to 500ms, and timeout as default (10 times), and the server is dead/won't respond, it will take 5000ms to detect that, as the library will send 10 challenge packets which will timeout after 500ms.


Todo:

[ ] Proper Unit Tests
[ ] Further Testing
[ ] Code clean up

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is a simple package made for C#/.NET Source Query Requests. Main features are the default requests that can also be found on the source query documentation in the [Valve developer community wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries). For a list of implemented requests see the roadmap below.

### Built With

* [.NET-Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/standard/net-standard)
* [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

## Usage

First download the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okolni.Source.Query/) and import the namespace `Okolni.Source.Query` which is the main namespace. After that you can use the project as in the code example below. You create a query connection with an ip and a port and after connecting you can get started with your requests.
```
IQueryConnection conn = new QueryConnection();

conn.Host = "127.0.0.1"; // IP
conn.Port = 27015; // Port

conn.Connect(); // Create the initial connection

var info = conn.GetInfo(); // Get the Server info
var players = conn.GetPlayers(); // Get the Player info
var rules = conn.GetRules(); // Get the Rules
```
_For an example view the demo project [Demo](https://github.com/Florian2406/Okolni-Source-Query/blob/master/doc/Okolni.Source.Example/Program.cs)_

<!-- _For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ -->


## Roadmap

Implemented so far:
- Source Query Servers
- Info Request
- Players Request
- Rules Request
- The Ship Servers

Missing at the moment:
- Multipacket responses
- Goldsource Servers

Also see the [open issues](https://github.com/Florian2406/Okolni-Source-Ouery/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
